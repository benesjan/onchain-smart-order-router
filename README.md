# path-registry
A smart contract which has 2 functions:
1. A registration and a quality verification of Uniswap v2 and v3 paths.
2. Swapping tokens using the registered path.
A path is selected based on input and output token addresses and the amount of input token to swap.

The goal of this project is to make optimal swap paths available in smart contracts without compromising
on trustlessness.
